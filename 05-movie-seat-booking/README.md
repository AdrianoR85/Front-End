## About Project
A web page, where you selects the desired film and seat. If you adds or removes a place, the price changes. When clicking on "Book Now" the movie and the chosen seats are saved, if you reload the page the seats will show up. I used the localStorage property to store and retrieve the data in the user's browser.

## Technologies:
  * Html
  * CSS
  * Javascript
